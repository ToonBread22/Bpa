        <p style="font-family:Optima;">Electric cars are the new way of driuving they do not populte the air what so ever. NO more stops at the gas station you have an at home charging port for you vehichle. Which is really sweet. The reason for us going solar means we don't need to use outlets for electric cars you just hook them up to the sun and Boom they are charged.
