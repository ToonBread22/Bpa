        Carbon footprint is the emmision of of greenhouses gases that are produced as a result of to support human activities directly and indirectly.
         These emmisions can be from the cause of production of things we se today on a daily basis, or even emmissions from things we operate daily, like fuel power vehicles that burn oil which omits CO2 into the atmosphere.
          Humans are leaning more and more on things that increase carbon emmissions which is expediting the proccess of global warming, even if your home up with electricity, or buy food from the grocery store, these are also things that emit some quantities of Carbon emission.
