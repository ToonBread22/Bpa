We can reduce the amount of fossil fuels used if we switch to a more fuel efficent car or switch to a all electric car. </th>

If we can reduce the time run on the facytories we would be reducing pollution tremanedicly. To do so we need to get people invole, so getting people to sign patisience and wavers for the cause.   </th>
