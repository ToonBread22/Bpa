                        <th>⭐The burning of fosil fuels releases a large amount of nitrogen oxide and arbon dioxide into the air which will then trap heat in our atmosphere and casue the temperature to rise, aka global warming. We can reduce the amount of fossil fuels used if we switch to a more fuel efficent car or switch to a all electric car. </th>
                        <th>⭐Factories play big roles in the pollution world. They are the quarter backs of the opperation. If we can reduce the time run on the facytories we would be reducing pollution tremanedicly. To do so we need to get people invole, so getting people to sign patisience and wavers for the cause.   </th>
                        <th>⭐Fracking can cause alot of harm to our environment aswell. If done incorrectly the well can leak and cause what is known as "flowback" this is when the chemicals form the fracking fluid leaks into a water supply. These cancer causing chemicals include, benezene and toluene. Worst of all the government doesnt require the company to public state what has leaked and where it leaked.</th>
